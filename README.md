# BERN01 - Modelling in Computational Science

This repository contains homework assignments for the course **BERN01: Modelling in Computational Science** at Lund University (2025).

### 1. Particle Simulation of Gas-Liquid Phase Transition
A Monte Carlo-based simulation to model phase transitions between gas and liquid using Lennard-Jones potential. Includes visualization and analysis of energy and density distributions.

### 2. Modeling of Cell Reprogramming Dynamics
A system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to simulate gene regulatory dynamics during cell reprogramming, based on biological hypotheses and convergence behavior.

### 3. Predicting Plant Geography and Carbon Fluxes Using Random Forest
A machine learning approach using Random Forests to predict plant distribution and carbon fluxes based on climatic and environmental variables. Includes data preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation.
